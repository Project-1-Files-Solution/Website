			<p>1. DAMAGED ITEM

Every item and every part is thoroughly inspected prior to despatch. All our items come with superior packing materials. Every care is taken to ensure individual parts are securely wrapped and are damage-proof during travel. We take these measures to provide quality service.

Please check the items thoroughly for any damage as soon as you receive them and prior to installation. Ensure great care while taking out fragile parts from the carton box and removing the packaging.

Please note the following:</p>
<li>Kindly report any breakage or damage to the items within 3 days from receipt of the items to sales@lightosphere.com.au. Insurance cover requires claims to be made immediately and hence any issues reported after this timeframe will not be considered for free of charge replacement.</li>

<li>Any physical damage, abuse, misuse, unauthorised repair or tampering of parts will make your claim invalid.</li>
